Hyperparameter tuning of roberta and bertweet on irony detection dataset cardiffnlp/tweet_eval

Created with colab 

Note: This code works well! ("Errors" in these notebooks are not actually errors, they are the result of me cleaning up the code after I was done and accidentally running some code cells again. Due to Colab's GPU restrictions I was not able to run the whole process again.)
